Slot Antena Simulation GUI on MATLAB for a Scientific Research Project â€“ 
600 MHz Slot Antenna Study and Characterization (Computer Modeling and 
Simulation on MATLAB, applying a two-dimensional Fourier transform to the 
radiated fields over a single slotted metallic surface). The entire project 
was submitted for evaluation by an academic panel in March 2013.

ABSTRACT: Antennas are telecommunication system devices designed to 
transmit or receive energy in the form of signals. Antennas must be 
dimensioned according to the electrical, magnetic, and geometric 
characteristics of the materials contained therein, so they can be given 
the desired features to be 
integrated into such systems. This academic work proposes the study of 
antennas, specifically slot antennas, also including experimental analysis 
by determining parameters such as radiation pattern and frequency response. 
The slot antenna is characterized by easy configuration and construction 
and is mainly used in mobile phone systems and radar systems.

Keywords: Slot Antenna, Antenna Theory, Radiation Pattern, RF Measurements.

The code was updated to MATLAB R2025a version, there are 2 files: 
slot_antenna_simulation.mlapp (main code) + slot_antenna_simulation_exported.m 
(exported code) file.
